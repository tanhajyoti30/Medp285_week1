            <p> <b>Hello! My name is Tanha Jyoti.</b> I am Junior at CUNY Hunter College marjoring in Computer Science. I am majoring in computer science because I  love problem solving and desinging new things. Additionally, I recently find myself interested in Web desinginhg. Since, the Media Deperpant at Hunter College offer this class; I'm very excited to take this course and learn different things about web dev to build my skills.</br>Additionally, I enjoy every type of art because it doesn't have any language. Art makes me breathe with happiness and think creatively. I try to apply this creativity to make my work unique and meaningful. There is no specific feild that my work fall in; sometimes I practice my drawing skills, someimes I desing, sometimes I edit photos. But regardless of what I am doing my goal is to make the viewers understand my feeling and make a connection with it.
In future, I dream to be an artist through whom atleast one person will be inspired.<hr><h1>A Picture of Me</h1>
